# OKCupidSearch

**!! IMPORTANT !!** Please read the following: Before the program is ran in the terminal, the OKCupid search params MUST be set in the browser! The program's new browser instances know nothing of your cached settings.

**Example usage:**
```javascript
gentoo@gentoo:~/Python/OKCupidSearch$ python src/okcupidsearch.py -eexample@email.com -ppassword -kMike
```
